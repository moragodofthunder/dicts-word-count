As I was going to St. Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Every wife had seven sacks
Every sack had seven cats
Every cat had seven kits
Kits, cats, sacks, wives.
How many were going to St. Ives?

Refactor wordcount.py to break up your code into functions. Be strategic and considerate with
 how you decide to break up your code.


When designing functions, your goal will be to create ones that are easy for other developers
 to use. If you break your code up into too many functions, it’ll be hard for someone to figure 
 out how they all relate to each other. If you don’t have enough functions, then you risk 
 creating gigantic, mega-functions that will also be difficult to understand.
